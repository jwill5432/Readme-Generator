## Description
A node application that takes user input to create a readme file. Creating readmes usually take a while simply because there are several different things that are required to be put into a readme, but it can be taxing to remember which is which. In order to circumnavigate this issue, the idea of a readme generator with specific prompt guidelines was made. This way it becomes simple to create a readme using just the node.js command line.

## Installation
Install the node.js command prompt from the node.js website. When that is completed, use the command line to navigate to the folder that this program is in. Once that is completed, use the command "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to install inquirer. Once that is completed, enter "node index.js" to initiate the program. Enter everything it asks for in each prompt, and one that is completed, there will be a shiny new readme generated for you.

## Usage
Navigate to the file in the command line, enter "node index.js" and enter anything you want in response to the prompts. This will craete the readme file with the answers to your prompts in the sections that correlate with them.
